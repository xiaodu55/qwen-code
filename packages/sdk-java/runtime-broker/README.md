# Qwen Managed Runtime Broker Core

This Java 21 module defines the state and embeddable orchestration core for a
Managed Agent Runtime Broker. It contains Runtime binding, Runtime Session,
and Tool execution records; repository contracts; thread-safe in-memory
and JDBC implementations; and a framework-neutral service that composes
authoritative scope resolution, Runtime provisioning, and Runtime transport
adapters.

The service acquires operation and dispatch leases, renews them while external
work is in flight, converges idempotent Tool execution, records cancellation
intent, and fails ambiguous dispatch outcomes as `UNKNOWN`.
`reconcileExecution` asks the original Runtime about an `UNKNOWN` execution
and settles it only on that Runtime's terminal answer; it never replays the
call. A persisted `READY` binding is never reused by a new process without
proof: a binding whose request carries a durable provisioner kind is adopted
only after the provisioner observes the physical resource and the Broker
re-attests the Runtime identity through the transport, while a legacy binding
still fails closed with `runtime_reconciliation_required`; see
[Runtime binding reconciliation](../../../docs/design/2026-09-24-runtime-binding-reconciliation.md).

The module ships one local process provider, `LocalProcessRuntimeProvisioner`,
which starts the merged Managed Runtime worker and adopts it only after
attestation; see
[Managed Runtime process adoption](../../../docs/design/2026-09-23-managed-runtime-process-adoption.md).
The embedding service still owns the worker command wiring, recovery-capable
provisioners, and any container or remote provider. The module
intentionally does not expose an HTTP API, wire Spring, call the Hosted
Harness, or define public Agent resources. Those adapters belong to later PRs.

Building and running this module requires JDK 21 or later. Its Maven release
target is 21; services embedding the resulting JAR must also use JDK 21 or later.

Build and test with:

```bash
mvn test
mvn checkstyle:check
```

## JDBC persistence

`JdbcRuntimeBrokerSchema.initialize(DataSource)` installs the four private
Broker tables. The JDBC implementations use `javax.sql.DataSource` for
database access and fastjson2 (2.0.65) as the `reference_json`/`result_json`
codec; the embedding service owns the connection pool and schema lifecycle.
`JdbcRuntimeBindingRepository` additionally requires a `SecretProtector`
(`AesGcmSecretProtector` is included): the provision seed of a durable binding
and the lease token of a legacy binding are stored encrypted, so the key
material must come from the embedding service's own durable secret store and
stay stable across restarts and instances.
Tool execution rows preserve idempotency identity, dispatch ownership and
lease, cancellation intent, `UNKNOWN` recovery state, and the final result.
Tool execution identifiers are globally unique repository keys. The embedding
service must derive them from authenticated tenant, workspace, and session
context because this repository interface does not carry separate scope
arguments.
This module intentionally does not wire a Spring service or dispatch Tool
calls.

Before upgrading an installation that already used the Broker, stop new
admission and check for historical seeded failures:

```sql
SELECT tenant_id, COUNT(*) AS failed_bindings
FROM qwen_runtime_binding
WHERE binding_state = 'FAILED' AND provision_seed_ciphertext IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tenant_id;
```

The new placement guard blocks affected tenants, including when a later
generation is `READY`. Do not resume their traffic until the original writer
domain is physically stopped and an evidence-preserving operator migration is
available. This module does not ship that migration; deleting old rows or
fabricating stop evidence would lose the safety fence. A nonempty result is a
rollout blocker for this database.

Run the optional real-MySQL contract with:

```bash
mvn -Pmysql-integration \
  -Dmysql.url='jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/runtime_broker_test' \
  -Dmysql.user=root \
  -Dmysql.password= \
  verify
```

Durable rows alone do not make a stopped local Runtime process recoverable.
For a binding without durable identity the embedding service must reconcile a
persisted lease before reuse and own the process adoption or reprovisioning
policy; a durable binding is reconciled and adopted by the Broker itself.

## Trusted local recovery

Durable local provisioning and trusted reboot recovery are separate opt-ins;
see the [adoption design](../../../docs/design/2026-09-27-local-runtime-adoption.md)
and [reboot cleanup design](../../../docs/design/2026-09-28-local-reboot-recovery.md).
`recoverBinding(bindingId, expectedGeneration)` observes and cleans only the
saved generation. It does not resolve current product authorization or create
replacement workers. Managed Workspace embeddings must implement
`RuntimeProvisioner.recoverResources` to clear their original physical holder;
the default refuses managed cleanup. Only then may `finishLostRecovery` retire
the saved binding. Custom binding repository implementations must implement the
new bounded candidate query and cleanup finalization contract. There is no new
public HTTP recovery endpoint or database migration in this slice.

## Fault gates

The Stage F fault gates run the service in real Broker JVMs against the real
bundled worker, with a fault-injecting HTTP proxy between them and a
file-backed H2 database behind a relay that can be cut. They drop, reset,
delay or hold Runtime answers, kill workers and Broker JVMs, freeze a Broker
past its lease, and take the database away, then check that no tool call
runs twice or settles without the Runtime's evidence. The FG5 gates do the
same around W0c context installation on managed-context/1: no tool runs
before the context is installed and activated, and none runs outside the
Session's directory; see
[Runtime Broker Fault Gates](../../../docs/design/2026-09-26-runtime-broker-fault-gates.md).
They need the bundle, Node.js and POSIX signals, and fail when any is
missing. The default `mvn test` excludes them. From the repository root, run
`npm run build && npm run bundle`, then in this module:

```bash
mvn -Pfault-gates test
```

`-Dqwen.cli.entry=/path/to/dist/cli.js` points them at another bundle.

## Workspace binding

The `com.alibaba.qwen.code.runtimebroker.managedworkspace` package holds the
W0a Workspace binding contract; see
[Managed Workspace Binding Contract](../../../docs/design/2026-09-25-managed-workspace-binding-contract.md).
It defines the Workspace Registry record and an immutable snapshot built from
deployment configuration, actor-scoped access with an explicit-grant policy,
a catalog that lists Workspaces and resolves a Session's Workspace selection
to one resolved Workspace or one typed error, the lexical rule for a
Session's working directory, and `ContextBinding` with its `contextDigest`.
The TypeScript implementation in
`packages/cli/src/serve/managed-workspace-binding.ts` produces the same
normalized directories and digests; both run the shared fixtures in
`packages/cli/src/serve/contracts/managed-workspace-binding-v1.fixtures.json`.
The fixtures of the `managed-context/1` envelope,
`packages/cli/src/serve/contracts/managed-context-v1.fixtures.json`, carry
context digests computed with the same encoding, and
`ManagedContextEnvelopeConformanceTest` recomputes them; see
[Managed Context Envelope](../../../docs/design/2026-09-25-managed-context-envelope.md).
Both fixture files carry unpaired surrogates as `\uXXXX` escapes on purpose,
so read them with a parser that keeps such escapes, as Jackson does.
The package uses only the JDK and no other Broker class, and nothing wires
it into the Broker service yet.

## Tool result contract

`ManagedToolResultConformanceTest` consumes the `managed-tool-result/1`
contract in
`packages/core/src/managed-runtime/contracts/managed-tool-result-v1.fixtures.json`:
the result manifest, segment pages, segment publication and the Tool v3
routes that carry the versioned result envelope. It pins the constants,
routes, closed key sets and error table, and recomputes every segment, seal
and prefix digest; see
[Managed Tool Result Contract](../../../docs/design/2026-09-26-managed-tool-result-contract.md).
The fixtures carry unpaired surrogates as `\uXXXX` escapes on purpose too.
No Java transport speaks Tool v3 yet.
